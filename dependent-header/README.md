# dependent-header

Run `make simulate` and then visit the [header inspector](http://localhost:10000/#/Request_inspection/get_headers) in your browser

You should see two headers (next to other headers) that look like this:

```
"X-Contains-Google-Apis": "true",
"X-Contains-Some-Other-Weird-Stuff": "false",
```
